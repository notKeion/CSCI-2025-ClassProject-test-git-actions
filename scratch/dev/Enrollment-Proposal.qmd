## Project Motivation

College administrators and stakeholders need to understand enrollment trends quickly and accurately.

While visualizations show patterns, they often require interpretation to answer:
- What changed?
- Why does it matter?
- What should we notice first?

Our project combines **interactive enrollment visualizations** with an **automated narrative system** that explains the data clearly and responsibly.

---

## Project Goal

Our goal is to build an interactive dashboard that:
- Visualizes College of Idaho enrollment data
- Highlights trends, composition, and changes over time
- Automatically generates plain-language explanations for each chart

This ensures the data is **accessible**, **interpretable**, and **actionable**.

---

## Key Questions We Will Answer

- How has total enrollment changed over time?
- What portions of enrollment are first-year vs continuing students?
- Where are students coming from geographically?
- Which academic programs are growing or shrinking?
- What are the most important takeaways from each visualization?

---

## Planned Visualizations

We plan to include the following visualizations:

- Line chart: Total enrollment by year
- Stacked bar chart: Enrollment by class standing
- Bar chart: In-state vs out-of-state enrollment
- Bar chart: Enrollment by major or division
- Change-focused charts highlighting growth or decline

Each visualization will be paired with automated narrative text.

---

## The Narrator Feature (Context Generator)

To help users interpret charts, our dashboard will include a **Narrator module** that:

- Automatically summarizes what each chart shows
- Uses a “Mad Libs” style text template
- Adapts language based on the data (increase, decrease, stable)
- Flags uncertainty or missing data when relevant

Example:
> “Total enrollment increased by 4.2% from Fall 2024 to Fall 2025, driven primarily by first-year students.”

---

## How the Narrator Works (Conceptual)

For each visualization, the Narrator will:
1. Extract key summary statistics
2. Determine trends and direction of change
3. Select an appropriate text template
4. Generate a concise, readable explanation

This approach ensures consistency across the dashboard and reduces misinterpretation.

---

## Quality Assurance & Data Responsibility

The Narrator also serves as a built-in Quality Assurance layer by:
- Avoiding misleading claims when data is incomplete
- Handling missing values and small sample sizes
- Ensuring consistent rounding and terminology
- Adding notes when interpretation should be cautious

This helps maintain accuracy and trust in the dashboard.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- R and tidyverse for data manipulation
- ggplot2 for visualization
- stringr and glue for narrative generation
- Quarto for presentation and documentation
- GitHub for version control and collaboration

---

## Project Timeline

- Data exploration and cleaning
- Visualization development
- Narrative template design
- QA testing and validation
- Final dashboard integration and presentation

Each component will be developed in parallel and integrated incrementally.

---

## Expected Outcome

By the end of the project, we will deliver:
- A polished set of enrollment visualizations
- Automated narrative explanations for each chart
- A dashboard that communicates insights clearly to all users

This project demonstrates both technical and interpretive data skills.

---

## Next Steps

- Finalize enrollment dataset structure
- Assign visualization ownership
- Begin narrator template implementation
- Conduct early QA testing
- Merge features into final dashboard

Thank you!

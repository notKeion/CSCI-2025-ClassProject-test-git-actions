1) Data Steward - Jack
- Finalize any updates to the dfw rate column
- Create gpa conversion column 
- Mainly should be jumping in to help when needed. There might be other things I can't think of. If not though, individual project work could be great.

2) Chart Artist - Chase
- Begin making plots with additional columns from Jack
Address the following questions:
    - How do students within same standing preform?
    - Are there any uniquely "bottleneck" courses?
    - How do different departments compare to one another?
    - How does a student's success progress throughout their time at the college?

3) Interface Architect - Logan
- Develop a prototype app
I imagine this being a very barebones skeleton of an app. There should be pages dedicated to the questions each with columns and rows set up and ready to be updated.

4) Narrative Lead - Aayush
- Begin drafting a quarto document (learn how to utilize shiny in quarto)
- Likely you might need a bit more information to really start work on the quarto so individual project work is great here too.
